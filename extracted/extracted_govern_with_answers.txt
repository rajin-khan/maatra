Invalid Answer: We do not have any specific policies or procedures in place for managing third-party AI risks.
Invalid Reason: The invalid answer fails because it does not provide evidence of established policies and procedures for managing third-party AI risks, including transparency, testing, and evaluation of third-party systems, as required by the validator and described in the playbook context.

Title: GOVERN 6.2
Queries:
  - Q1: What procedures does your organization have in place to address potential failures in third-party AI systems?
  - Q2: How do you currently assess and manage risks associated with third-party datasets?
  - Q3: What mechanisms are in place for reporting and addressing potential vulnerabilities in third-party AI systems?
Validator: The answer should describe specific policies, procedures, or mechanisms in place for mitigating risks associated with third-party AI system failures, including consideration of redundancy, incident response plans, and risk assessment for third-party datasets, and should mention the involvement of relevant stakeholders such as third-party entities, AI deployment teams, and operation and monitoring personnel.
Valid Answers:
  - VA1: Our organization has established a comprehensive incident response plan that includes procedures for handling failures in third-party systems, which involves the AI deployment team, operation and monitoring personnel, and third-party entities. We also conduct regular risk assessments for third-party datasets and have a process in place for third parties to report potential vulnerabilities.
  - VA2: We have implemented policies and procedures that include redundancy mechanisms for vital third-party AI systems, and our incident response plan specifically addresses third-party AI systems. Additionally, we assess and manage the risks associated with third-party datasets and have established a process for third parties to report potential vulnerabilities.
Invalid Answer: We don't have any specific procedures in place for third-party AI failures.
Invalid Reason: The invalid answer fails because it does not describe any specific policies, procedures, or mechanisms in place for mitigating risks associated with third-party AI system failures, as required by the validator. According to the playbook context, organizations should establish policies for handling third-party system failures and verify that incident response plans address third-party AI systems, which is not mentioned in the invalid answer.
