## What is Colorado SB205?

On May 17, 2024, Colorado Governor Jared Polis signed SB24-205 into law, introducing comprehensive consumer protections for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. SB205 imposes rigorous requirements on developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to safeguard consumers from algorithmic discrimination. Due to be enforced from 1 February 2026, the countdown for compliance has begun.
