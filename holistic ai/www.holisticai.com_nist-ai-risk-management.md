## What is the NIST AI Risk Management Framework?

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a US federal agency to promote measurement science, standards, and technology to enhance productivity, facilitate trade, and improvethe quality of life as well as one of the leading institutions in AI standards. The institute launched the AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) 1.0 In January 2023. The RMF is a voluntary framework developed through a collaborative process with the involvement of public and private actors and intended to incorporate trustworthiness into the design, development, deployment, and evaluation of AI products and services.

## Why get involved with the AI Risk Management Framework?

NIST RMF is the most comprehensive and collaborative framework in the US in the field of AI standardization, the outputs of which may emerge as sector standards or best practices. Our governance platform is an all-in-one solution, providing you with the tools and resources you need to get prepared for the emerging global standards and implement the NIST AI RMF suggestions.
