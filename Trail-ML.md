## üß© Relation to Maatra

| Trail ML                          | Maatra (Assumed)                                | Relationship |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Strong policy automation tools   | If Maatra focuses on explainability or evaluation | Complementary / Overlapping |
| Visual dashboard for governance  | If Maatra lacks visual policy integration         | Trail may appear more mature |
| ISO & EU AI Act alignment        | If Maatra isn‚Äôt yet tied into regulatory systems  | Trail has regulatory edge |
| Copilot integration for roles    | Maatra may focus more on dev/technical usage      | Trail leans heavily on non-dev stakeholders too |

üìå **Conclusion**: Trail ML is a **strong governance-layer competitor** for platforms like Maatra. If Maatra is more focused on explainable ML or model evaluation, Trail complements it. If Maatra plans to expand into compliance/governance, Trail is a direct rival.
