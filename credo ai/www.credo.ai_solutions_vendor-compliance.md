## Track vendor solutions in a centralized registry

Customers can register their third-party AI systems on Credo AI's platform, similar to their internally built AI systems. All use cases are consolidated in a comprehensive organizational AI Registry.

## Define vendor requirements

Customers can apply Credo AI Policy Packs to vendor solutions, setting specific requirements. For example, customers can evaluate an HR tool's compliance with New York City Local Law 144 (LL-144) by registering the tool in Credo AI's platform and applying the corresponding policy pack for LL-144.

## Request evidence from vendors

Vendors receive an email with a link and login to the vendor portal. They are responsible for proving that their system meets the policy pack requirements

## Generate risk and compliance reports and dashboards

The evidence provided by vendors is captured in Credo AI's platform and can be used by customers to generate reports, dashboards, and other artifacts based on the evidence.

Credo AI's Vendor Portal simplifies the procurement process by providing a standardized way for customers to collect and evaluate AI risk-specific evidence from vendors.
