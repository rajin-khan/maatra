# Adopt the NIST AI RMF with Credo AI

As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence continues to grow at a rapid pace, organizations must take immediate action to prioritize the responsible use and development of this powerful technology. To support this endeavor, the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) developed the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) to guide organizations in managing and mitigating AI-related risks effectively.

**Implementing the NIST AI RMF can be a complex process.**

Nonetheless, with Credo AI's Governance software, organizations can tackle the complexities of implementing the critical NIST AI RMF framework with ease. As [contributors](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework/perspectives-about-nist-artificial-intelligence-risk-management) to the development of the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (NIST AI RMF) and [participants](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2023/01/nist-ai-risk-management-framework-ai-rmf-10-launch) at its official launch in the U.S. Department of Commerce, Credo AI has developed a comprehensive solution to help organizations adopt the framework with ease.
