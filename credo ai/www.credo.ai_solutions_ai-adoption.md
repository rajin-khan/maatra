## Centralize AI visibility

AI adoption is often fragmented, and many projects fail to take off due to a lack of stakeholder participation and buy-in.

Our AI Registry provides a centralized source of truth for tracking AI/ML products in development or uses across the enterprise. With this tool, you can easily identify where and how AI is being used, which teams are involved, and in which products or offerings it is being utilized.

## Surface and mitigate risks

Our platform automatically evaluates metadata about your use cases to identify and suggest potential risks and business impacts. Additionally, to translate those insights into action, our AI Registry suggests relevant Policy Packs recommendations for your specific use cases, helping you mitigate those risks.
