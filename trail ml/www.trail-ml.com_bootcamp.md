## How we helped companies blaze a trail   in AI Governance

trail’s knowledgeable team and powerful platform align perfectly with our mission for responsible AI. Their tool streamlined our path to ISO 42001 certification by transforming the AI Management System (AIMS) creation into clear, actionable steps \- eliminating the need to manually interpret norms or create tickets from scratch. With progress tracking, seamless collaboration, and smart evidence mapping, trail made the process faster and more transparent. Their AI Policy generation also helped us communicate our commitment to AI governance, strengthening trust with stakeholders.”

## Frequently asked questions

Do you have open questions about trail's AI Governance bootcamp? Find an answer below, or send your question directly to [hello@trail-ml.com](mailto:hello@trail-ml.com?subject=Question%20on%20AI%20Governance%20Bootcamp).

### What is the "AI Governance Bootcamp"?

The bootcamp is a structured 8-week program to help you acquire the knowledge and guidance needed to build up your company's AI Governance process.

The program is a mixed format of workshops, workbook-style exercises, peer exchange and 1:1 mentoring.

You are required to work through the program yourself. Leverage our best practices to get the work done and rely on the experts for advice and help.

After the program, you will have a working AI Governance foundation and a clear roadmap of next steps.

### What will be my role during the bootcamp?

You will work on your own AI Governance process during the bootcamp, and deliver first, tangible results (e.g. AI registry, literacy program, mapping of governance requirements to processes and roles, etc.). These will lay the foundation for any future AI use case that you need to govern. You can work through the tasks at your own pace, and the trail team will support you along the way.

If you choose the cohort plan, you will be part of a collective learning process with other companies' AI Governance pioneers.

### For whom is this program?

The AI Governance Bootcamp is great for organizations and enterprises who want to get started on AI Governance fast and effectively from scratch — without overengineering AI Governance or needing a huge budget.

If you are championing Responsible AI in your company, you will be a great fit for this program.

### What does it cost?

The cost depends on the plan you have chosen. The cohort plan starts at 8.000,00 EUR. The price of the intensive plan depends on your preferred individualization, as it is a more personal setting. Please reach out to us if you want to learn more about the intensive plan.

### Why and when should I sign up for this program?

This program is perfect for you if you are just starting to set up AI Governance processes within your organization, and if you only have a basic understanding or structure of AI compliance and governance.

We will give you the knowledge and best practices to have an effective, light-weight solution to AI Governance that fits your individual needs.

You will also be able to deliver first results, such as assigning roles & responsibilities, collecting AI use cases in your AI registry, having an AI literacy program in place and creating an AI policy.

### Why do it with trail?

Our team has diverse expertise in AI Governance and covers technical, as well as compliance aspects. Our experts have experience in advising companies in AI Governance, as well as implementing our governance solution trail in SMBs and enterprises with high-risk AI use cases. We are working together with relevant standardization and certification bodies in Europe and bring the latest knowledge to the table. This enables us to guide you in practicing AI Governance, both to scale your AI adoption rates and to prepare you for upcoming regulation, such as the EU AI Act.

### How does this program work?

Over the duration of the AI Governance Bootcamp, we will have various calls and workshops in which you will get the knowledge and best practices of AI Governance. These workshops will also be interactive. After each session or phase, you will also get assignments to work on. For example, this can be the selection of a governance framework for your organization, the mapping of governance requirements to existing processes, or the creation of an AI use case collection concept. The trail team will then review your work and answer all your questions around the respective topics.

### Do I need to invest 8 weeks into this program?

The aim of this program is to enable you to get you started on governing AI on your own. We will advise you to proactively participate in the 8-week program, meaning to participate in the calls and workshops as well as to work on the capstone assignments. However, you will have access to all the materials afterward and you can work on the assignments after the program at your own pace.

If you choose the intensive plan, we can also adapt the timeline of the program to your individual needs.

### Can I bring colleagues?

Yes, you can bring relevant colleagues of yours into the program and the workshops. Please note that there are limited seats per cohort, meaning that we may also need to limit the number of colleagues that you can bring.

### What will be the outcome?

If you stick to the 8-week plan, you will have:

1. An understanding about your AI and AI Governance maturity in your organization
2. A suitable AI registry and use case collection process
3. Chosen the governance frameworks to apply to your organization
4. Designed an AI literacy program
5. Analyzed the gaps between existing processes and governance requirements
6. Identified the according roles & responsibilities in your organization
7. Created an AI policy
8. Created an AI Governance roadmap and action plan for your organization for the upcoming months and years

### Will trail do the work for me?

No, but the team of trail will support and guide you in creating your AI Governance process and delivering first results. We will even support you for another 12 months after the program.

### What happens after the program?

After trail's AI Governance Bootcamp, you have access to all the relevant resources and material to continue governing AI in your organization. You will also gain limited access to trail's tools (e.g. the AI registry) and access to a community of other professionals in the AI Governance scene. Further, you get 1 year of trail's advisory support, meaning you can contact us at any time to have an expert answer your individual questions.
