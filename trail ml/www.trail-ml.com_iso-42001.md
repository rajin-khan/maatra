It was a pleasure to partner with trail on this exciting pilot project - the first TÜV SÜD ISO/IEC 42001 certification in Europe. Trail played a crucial role in the project's success with their knowledgeable team and innovative software tooling, which made the preparation and auditing process clearer and more efficient. Their client Unique AG was well-prepared for ISO 42001, and we are glad to see the successful completion of the audit.”

## Frequently asked questions

Do you have open questions about trail's support with your ISO/IEC 42001 implementation? Find an answer in our FAQ below, or send your question directly to [hello@trail-ml.com](mailto:hello@trail-ml.com?subject=Question%20on%20ISO%2042001%20with%20trail).

### What is ISO/IEC 42001?

In short, ISO/IEC 42001 is the **first internationally recognized standard for AI management systems (AIMS)**. It provides a structured framework for organizations to manage the risks, responsibilities, and ethical implications of using artificial intelligence. The standard covers areas such as AI governance and accountability, risk and impact assessments, data quality and bias mitigation, and human oversight and transparency. By implementing ISO 42001, companies can demonstrate that they’re using AI responsibly, ethically, and in line with global best practices.

### Who should get certified?

In general, **any company that has AI use cases** and wants to **signal their trustworthiness** to their customers should consider getting ISO/IEC 42001 certified. Also, when you want to bring more structure to your AI management and if you want to prepare for regulation, the ISO/IEC 42001 can be a great solution for you.

### Am I automatically ISO/IEC 42001-certified if I'm using trail?

No — using trail **does not automatically make you ISO 42001-certified**. trail prepares you for certification and gives you all the tools to build, document, and maintain an ISO 42001-compliant AI management system (AIMS). But **certification must come from an external certifier**, such as TÜV Süd, DEKRA, or BSI.

### Why do it with trail?

We've **supported one of the very first ISO/IEC 42001 certifications** of a client in the financial services in Europe, and in close collaboration with a certification body.

Our team has diverse **expertise in AI Governance** and covers technical, as well as compliance aspects. We also have a certified ISO/IEC 42001 lead auditor as an in-house expert. The trail team has experience in advising companies in AI Governance, as well as **implementing our governance solution trail in SMEs and enterprises with high-risk AI use cases**. This enables us to guide you in practicing AI Governance, both to scale your AI adoption rates and to prepare you for upcoming regulation, such as the EU AI Act.

### Will trail help me find an auditor?

Yes, we have established connections to competent auditors and renowned certification bodies across Europe, but also on an international level. If you do not have a suitable auditor yet, we can help you find someone — just ask us!

### Is the ISO/IEC 42001 mandatory?

No — ISO 42001 is a voluntary standard, not a legal requirement. However, it’s rapidly becoming a **key trust signal** for companies building or deploying AI systems. Much like ISO 27001 for information security, ISO 42001 helps you stay ahead of regulatory developments, meet stakeholder expectations, and build trust with customers, regulators, and partners.

### Who should use trail?

trail is designed for **any organization developing and deploying AI systems** — whether you're a SME, enterprise, public institution, or consultancy. It’s especially valuable for companies preparing for ISO 42001 certification, AI teams looking to operationalize governance, compliance or risk teams managing AI-related risks, and consultants supporting clients through certification. Whether you're just starting or scaling up your AI governance, trail helps you structure your processes and become compliant in a smart way.

### Is trail issuing my certificate?

trail **does not** issue certifications directly. We support your certification journey with any certification body, including TÜV Süd, DEKRA, and others. This certification body is then issuing your certificate.

### What does the certification process with trail look like?

trail accelerates the path to ISO 42001 certification by helping you set up an AI management system aligned with the standard’s requirements. Using trail, you can build your AI management system with **pre-built templates** and **governance tools**, **document policies**, roles, and **risk assessments** directly on our platform, and **track compliance** with the help of an intelligent copilot. When you're ready, you can **export structured documentation** for review by a certification body like TÜV Süd or DEKRA and proceed with your preferred certifier to complete the audit.

### How long does the certification process take with trail?

The **time it takes** to get certified depends on how mature your current AI management and use case landscape is. Organizations with **prior experience in standards like ISO 27001** or **established AI risk management practices** may experience faster certification. trail helps accelerate the process by centralizing documentation, guiding you through each step, and keeping your system aligned with the latest requirements. You can start by taking our free ISO 42001 readiness assessment to get a tailored evaluation of your current status and next steps.
