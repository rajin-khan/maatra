## What is the EU AI Act?

The EU AI Act is the world's first legal framework designed to regulate Artificial Intelligence across the EU. It aims to ensure that AI systems are safe, respect existing laws on fundamental rights, and align with the EU's values.

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64d39f3feec1e3615e1504bd/65a2aff28ad6c1d35ef0cefa_Risk%20Classification%20EU%20AIA.webp)

### The AI Act introduces a risk-based approach, distinguishing between four kinds of AI systems:

### 1\. Unacceptable

AI applications that are incompatible with EU values and fundamental rights. They will be prohibited.

### 2\. High Risk

Highly regulated AI Systems that could cause significant harm if they are failing or misused, or that are safety components.

### 3\. Limited Risk

Applications that pose a risk of manipulation or deceit. They are less regulated, but have transparency obligations.

### 4\. Minimal Risk

All remaining AI systems. While they have no mandatory requirements, transparency and ethical use are encouraged.

## Failing to comply with the EU AI Act comes at a high cost

Non-compliance with the requirements of the EU AI Act will result in high penalties:

Up to **€35 million or 7%** of your global annual revenue for non-compliance with prohibited practices regulation or data requirements.

‍

Up to **€15 million or 3%** of your global annual revenue for non-compliance with any other regulatory requirements, such as those of high-risk systems or GPAI models.

‍

Up to **€7.5 million or 1.5%** of your global annual revenue for providing incorrect, incomplete or misleading information about your AI systems.

## When is the EU AI Act enforced?

The AI Act entered into force in August 2024. After 6 months, organizations that are putting AI systems into the EU market need to comply with the regulation on prohibited practices. After 12 months, obligations for general purpose AI models (GPAI) become applicable. All other obligations, including those on high-risk AI systems, become applicable after 24 months.

**Organizations are expected to comply with the EU AI Act starting in February 2025.**

### Registration in EU Database

High-risk system providers need to provide information about their applications, accessible to the public.
