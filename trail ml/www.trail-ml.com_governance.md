### Create Policies

trail guides you through the creation process and helps you to formalize the use of AI within your organization. Balancing best practices and your individual needs.

### Actionable

The goals, principles and requirements from your policies translate directly into actionable to-do's within trail.

# AI Policy Builder

Start your governance with creating a proper AI policy. Our copilot makes sure to translate your requirements into actionable steps for all of your teams.

# AI Registry

Gain clarity and control over all your organization's AI solutions. Oversee what you are building and using, in which stage, at which risk and who is responsible for each AI system.

### Oversight

Manage AI use cases from one central hub, classify model risk according to the EU AI Act, and access relevant project information to increase transparency across teams.

### All Data & Model Types

Text, tables, images, regressions, classifications or segmentations — each project looks different. trail supports all data and model types.

### Improved Collaboration

Reduce knowledge silos and dependencies with individualized views such that every team member can find and understand the right information at any time. Move from scattered information to a centralized information system. The trail copilot helps you to align technical and non-technical stakeholders for successful delivery of developed and procured systems.

### Role-Specific Tasks

Automatically assign tasks and responsibilities to the relevant project stakeholder, aligned with existing frameworks and immediately after defining your AI use-case.

### Automated Tests

Identify and mitigate compliance gaps effortlessly with trail, empowering teams for compliant engineering without additional overhead.

### Harmonize Regulation & Policies

The trail copilot supports you in embedding regulation or internal policies and frameworks into your existing governance processes at ease.

# Governance Workflows

Orchestrate and automate your AI Governance. trail supports you in organizing, integrating and simplifying your processes.

# Risk Management

Identify, classify and treat all AI-related risks. Use our pre-defined assessment template aligned with standards, or integrate your existing Risk Management workflows.

### Assess Risks

Choose from pre-defined risk assessment templates or bring your own to standardize Risk Management within your organization.

### Treat Risks

trail helps you to keep track of all identified risks and suggests you appropriate treatment measures.

### One-Click

Generate automated model, data and code documentation in minutes instead of hours. Always up-to-date with the latest model changes so that you can focus on the most important tasks and are ready for audits.

### Templates

Use our pre-defined templates based on various governance frameworks, such as IEEE or EU AI Act, to start right away.

### Multi-Purpose

Automatically create documentations that match each stakeholder's knowledge level and needs.

# Automated Documentation

Documentation is an important factor to understand what you did during development and to comply with policies, but it is very time-consuming. Time that trail gives you back.

# Audit Trail

Bring transparency and reliability to your AI projects, ultimately fostering trust.

### Experiment Tracking

View your machine learning development in an intuitive tree, allowing you to review and compare each experiment.

### Model Cards

Access all relevant metadata and artifacts of your models and datasets to have one single truth for your metadata.

### Traceback Decisions

Trace back the development using qualitative data to understand which and why decisions have been made.

## Value for the whole team

AI Governance is an interdisciplinary task, requiring the joint effort of various stakeholders.
