## AI risk management can be challenging

Common road-blockers are hindering both efficiency and trustworthiness:

### Missing understanding about AI risks

A lack of understanding about what you’re building makes managing associated risks and verifying quality impossible.

### Uncertainty about compliance gaps

Compliance and AI development are often treated independently of each other. This makes it difficult to identify compliance gaps when combining both at deployment.

Existing documentation of models and their development often does not include information about risks, increasing burdens to compliance and developers.
